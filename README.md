# Mission-to-Mars
In this project, we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
